# Coffee-Shop-Thread-Synchronization-Example
A Java demonstration of thread synchronization using producer-consumer pattern in a coffee shop scenario.

ðŸ“– Description
This project illustrates Java thread synchronization using wait() and notify() methods to coordinate between two threads:

Barista Thread (Producer): Prepares coffee

Customer Thread (Consumer): Waits for and consumes coffee

The program ensures proper thread communication where the customer waits until the coffee is ready before drinking it.


ðŸ’» Code Overview
Main Classes
coffeeShop Class
Fields:

coffeeReady: Boolean flag indicating coffee preparation status

Synchronized Methods:

makeCoffee(): Simulates coffee preparation (2-second delay)

drinkCoffee(): Handles coffee consumption with waiting mechanism

code6 Class (Main)
Creates coffeeShop instance

Launches two threads: Customer and Barista (BRU)

ðŸ”§ Key Concepts Demonstrated
Thread Synchronization: Using synchronized keyword

Inter-Thread Communication: wait() and notify() methods

Producer-Consumer Pattern: Barista produces, customer consumes

Thread Safety: Proper coordination between concurrent threads



Implement producer-consumer pattern

Handle thread coordination and communication



Pattern: Producer-Consumer

ðŸ”„ Program Flow
Customer thread starts and waits for coffee

Barista thread starts making coffee

Barista sleeps for 2 seconds (simulating preparation time)

Barista sets coffeeReady = true and calls notify()

Customer thread wakes up and drinks coffee

ðŸ“š Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

Basic understanding of Java threads

This project serves as an educational example for understanding thread synchronization concepts in Java programming.
